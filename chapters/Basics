\subsection{Vectors, 1-Forms, and Tensors}

\subsubsection{Two kinds of Vectors}

In curvilinear coordinate system \textit{u} , the coordinate curve $C_{i}$ (a circle for $\theta$ or x-axis for x) through a point p is the curve where all but $\textit{u}^i$ are constants, and where $\textit{u}^i $is used as a parameter.
 
The tangent vector to this curve is $\partial \mathbf { p } / \partial u ^ { i } \text { which we shall abbreviate to } \partial _ { i } \text { or } \partial / \partial u ^ { i }$.

These vectors form a basis for all vectors $\real{n}$
